Property Details:
- Bedrooms: 3
- Bathrooms: 2  
- Parking: 1
- Size: 650 sqm
- Suburb: Hornsby
- Distance from CBD: 36 km

Expected Output: $1,200,000 ± 18%
```

#### 2. Suburb Recommendation
```python
# Example: Find suburbs for Chinese community, $800/week budget
Filters:
- Ethnicity: Chinese
- Max Rent: $800/week
- Results: Top 10 matching suburbs with scores
